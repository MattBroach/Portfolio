_The Sensitive Screen_ is an installation designed to decouple the rhetoric of speed and efficiency from the rhetoric of technology. It is a functional digital screen, in which the 'pixels' of the screen are made with the touch-reactive plant Mimosa Pudica and computer-controlled motors -- the plants close when brushed by the motors, creating the 'off pixels' as opposed to the 'on pixels' of the still-open plants. The rate at which images appear on the screen is constrained by the biology of the Mimosa Pudica, which take about ten minutes to reopen. The Sensitive Screen, therefore, runs at the intentionally slow rate of six frames per hour.
