_Ubi Ex_ was a collaboration between Matt Nishi-Broach and artist/director Deena Selenow.  A semi-fictional company, Ubi Ex collected discarded film footage and other tokens of memory and used methods derived from various investigatory practices (forensics, topography, color analysis, and more) to discover the hidden histories within. Armed witha repurposed microscrope for film viewing and endless patience, the duo excavates the beauty of the forgotten history contained with our cultural ephemera.
